# Working with Data: Visualizing, Parsing Audiofiles, Reporting

This repository contains three files delving into different aspects of working with different types of data. 

## Description

This repository contains three assignments required for the completion of my Masters of Science in Data Science and AI. These assignments stand as the first introduction into the field of data science. They are as follows:

For Assignment 1, I'm focusing on data analysis and visualization using a pre-made dataset. This task involves exploring the dataset, conducting data manipulations, and presenting my findings through various graphical tools. It's a great opportunity for me to enhance my data handling skills and learn how to effectively communicate insights visually.

Assignment 2 is all about parsing audio files to extract vital information. I'm delving into the fascinating world of audio data processing, which includes tasks like speech recognition and audio feature extraction. This hands-on experience is not only improving my programming skills but also deepening my understanding of how multimedia data works.

In Assignment 3, I'm honing my writing skills by drafting a theoretical research proposal. This task requires me to outline a research project, detailing its goals, methodologies, and expected outcomes. It's a challenging yet rewarding exercise that helps me become better at expressing research ideas clearly and coherently, setting the stage for future academic and scientific endeavors.

These three assignments collectively provide me with a comprehensive educational experience, covering data analysis and visualization, technical audio data processing, and the essential skill of crafting well-structured research proposals.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* This project relied heavily on numpy and matplotlib.
* Librosa to parse and manipulate audiofiles.

### Executing program

Working through this program is relatively easy and can be simply done by downloading any dataset of your choosing and uploading it within the Jupyter notebook. Within that you can utilize the cells available to reveal truths in the data.
